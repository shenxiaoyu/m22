         <h2>Past</h2>
         <p>  
            Life is an adventure and I am always on the road.
            Five years ago, I decided to change my major from medical science to industrial design where I found my real passion. During my bachelor education at Zhejiang University, I explored various design fields ranging from product design, UX design, graphic design to tangible interaction. The experience of various projects enables me to take on different roles in a design team.
            My bachelor study also provided me with precious opportunities to have a worldwide journey. My understanding towards design has been broadening as well as my horizons and life experiences. Starting at Hangzhou where the Internet giant Alibaba is headquartered, I was inspired by the value of design in a business context and ran my first start-up as a project manager. At the third year of my bachelor, I went to Taiwan for exchange, the local designs deeply influenced me with their culture value and traditional crafts skills. To further improve myself, I joined the “3+2” excellence program and started a new journey at TU/e aiming to develop my own design vision and go further in that direction for new possibilities.

         <h2>Present</h2>
         <p>  
            Although starting with a struggling period of adaption, I developed my interests in user experience design and strong appreciation of the relationship between human and technologies. My learning experience at TU/e enables me to think not only from the perspective of a designer, but also from a researcher and an explorer. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The very first semester at TU/e was challenging because of the different education system and individual research project which are both fresh new to me. The outcome wasn’t as good as expected, but lessons were learned about the importance of research-powered design process and proper project management. I started to transfer my focus from the design projects to a rounded one, which shares an equal attention to my own development and the design process.
         </p>
         <p>
            In M12, I did a design project for persuasion and behavior change in a specific healthcare context: autism, which inspired me about the power of design to motivate or educate people in a pleasing way. To continue exploring interactive products in healthcare domain and how persuasion technology can help improving people’s well-being, I proposed my FMP as designing a daily healthcare product to prevent neck pain in workplace. Although challenging, the one-year project keep pushing me to step out of my comfort zone and absorb new knowledges or skills. During the process, I developed my competencies and gradually formed my own design strategy in designing for a specific context.

         <h2>FMP: Neckio</h2>
         <p>  <span class="image right"><img src="images/neckio.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            In my FMP, I designed, developed and evaluated a smart system intended to prevent neck pain by encouraging regular exercise during work hours. The system was conceived based on literature research and an extensive user survey. The design decisions were backed up by professional guidance from my client, Prof. dr. Annick Timmermans, who is an expert in rehabilitation science and physiotherapy. After going through an iterative design process with formative testing, I came to the final design that aims at providing an interactive exercises experience and better integrating the system into people’s daily routine in a minimally obstructive way. System user experience and users’ intrinsic motivation were evaluated positively in a short-term user evaluation. 
         </p>
         <p>
            So far, this project received positive feedback. I have been invited to pitching my work at Eindhoven Maker Faire 2016 by a communication advisor, who considered my work as fresh and inspiring. Besides, a lecturer from Homeschool Utrecht whose expertise lies in chronic care, also expressed her appreciation of Neckio and showed interest to cooperate in the future research.
         </p>
         <p>
            This project was taken as an opportunity for an overall evaluation of my abilities as a qualified designer. I acted as a project designer and a manager at the same time to manage the project with a clear plan and vigorous execution ability. During the project, I developed my skills in electronics prototyping and software programming by making the workable tracking device and application, which I had little experience before. Visual styles were iteratively explored, as well as the product design of tracking device, for visually aesthetic perception, better wearability and ease of use. To create a better user experience, I actively involved users, client, experts in design process and inspired by co-creation methods. Given the interim feedback, I tried hard to improve my writing skills by reading related books and writing a paper for my m12 project. The outcome of this learning activity is my final report, which is written in the form of a scientific paper.

         <b><i>To Make is To Grasp: from 2D to 3D</i></b>
         </br>
         <p> 
            Various techniques aiming at exploring and refining form were introduced in this elective, such as sketching with pencil, pastels, fine liner and markers, foam modeling, Photoshop and Illustrator. By applying these techniques to an original design, an all-in-one printer, lessons were learned about describing the aesthetic aspects of a design proposal. Design techniques should be chosen appropriately for different design case. During my final design task, I found it is hard to imagine an organic style by sketching on paper only, so a little piece of foam was used as 3D sketching to explore the shape.  By improving the resolution step by step, the prototype acted as the demonstrator of my design concepts in communication and idea sharing. The challenge here is how to avoid “very complete” deliverables but put more emphasis on the essential aspects or details in the design which elicits beauty in the experience. Furthermore, balancing the aesthetic and practical aspects of the product. My design was regarded as a sculpture more than a product in the design process. It was suggested to pay more attention to human-machine interaction details.

         <b><i>Design for Focused and Peripheral Interaction</i></b>
         </br>
         <p>  
            This course explored how to build on the way people effortlessly divide their attention over several everyday activities by designing interactive products and systems. My learning objectives of this elective is to gain an overview of attention theories and learn practical guidelines of peripheral interactions design and evaluation. This course started with an exploration of human attention abilities in both theory and practice, where the final design BUX was grounded. BUX is a controller for Philips Hue Light to interact with the lighting ambience at home in an effortless way. The process towards the final outcome came with frequent design iterations where potential peripheral factors were identified. As lecturer mentioned, ease of use doesn’t mean the interaction is peripheral. To tell whether an interaction is peripheral depends on the mental resource demand. Therefore, evaluating the designs with users in a stimulative context is necessary to get feedback and make further design decisions.

         <b><i>Scientific Paper Writing</i></b>
         </br>
         <p>  
            Apart from my graduation project, I also write a conference paper based on my m12 project with my previous coach Emilia Barakova during M2. Though the first two submission were both rejected, the paper was modified accordingly based on feedback. During this process, my skills at scientific writing were improved. At the third attempt, we finally got accepted by Intetain 2016. And I will go to Utrecht for presentation in July.

         <b><i>Exploration on co-creation methodology</i></b>
         </br>
         <p>  
            In m21, I organized a co-creation at Hasselt University with other three students. I benefitted a lot from the experience of methodologies application in creative session. Three methods were adopted in this co-creation: role-play, dirty prototyping and body storming. Different methods were found to emphasize different design perspectives. I am now more skilled at organizing creative sessions based on multiple methodologies.
         </p>
         <b><i>Volunteer work at DDW</i></b>
         </br>
         <p>  
            I worked as a volunteer in Dutch Design week 2015. It is a valuable experience for me to communicate with people who share the same enthusiasm but different vision towards design, which is even more inspiring compared to visiting the exhibitions only.

         </br>
         </br>
         <p>Designing is about bringing societal change, it affects people’s everyday life and work. My vision is to become a user-centered product designer, which requires empathy with the people who will be affected by the design process and its outcomes. During my study here, I found it important to keep involving stakeholders actively in design process. Through different design cases, I learned how to appropriately select and apply theories, approaches and methods to gain insights or feedback from people.</p>

         </br></br>
         <p>  
            During my study at TU/e, I realize and appreciate the relationship between human and technology. I believe designer should be able to demonstrate innovative concepts by building experienceable prototype using technology. I had little experience in technology-related prototyping before master program. Therefore, in the past two years, I keep working on this competency by following technology-related bachelor courses and online courses where I learned electronic prototyping, website development, hybrid mobile application development and coding languages such as Processing, HTML/CSS, Javascript, etc. The outcome of my learning activities could be seen in showcase development, prototypes in projects and courses.

         <b>3. Research through design</b>
         </br></br>
         <p>  
            I think a designer should find a good balance between subjectivity and objectivity, making and thinking, intuition and reason. My study here not only makes me a designer, but also a design-researcher. I begin to be aware and get familiar with research-powered design process, in this way my design was grounded with evidences from theories and studies. After two-years practice, I have formed my own approach where research and design are the two inseparable elements. During my projects, I explored different ways to manage my design process according to the nature of the design subject and context.

         <blockquote>
            Based on your final report M1.1 Research Project and the coach meetings we had during the semester I can conclude that you gained considerate awareness and understanding of doing a design research project.

         </br></br>
         <p>  
            This department provides an international education environment. At first, I did spend an adaption period with language difficulty and culture shock. Being encouraged, I gradually overcame my shyness and became more active and outspoken in group activities. To achieve this, I worked hard on my presentation skills and got fully prepared for every pitch. Now, I am able to understand the difference between people, culture or profession background, and motivate the team to work together towards a positive goal. My communication skills are also reflected on the management of design case which requires involvement of stakeholders and experts. Though sometimes the context or local language can become challenges to me, I kept close contact with stakeholders and experts and actively involve them into the design process where I got many useful insights and feedback.

This speaks about the appreciation of her work by the domain experts. Also this is an indication of her excellent way to communicate which makes people cooperate with her. This is a very important quality for a designer.<cite>Barakova, E.I. (Coach of M12 project)</cite>

            People are always the starting point and the destination of design. As a designer, I would like to put people in the heart of services and deliver services by designing interactive products. From the perspective of process, design should not focus on the result only, but also a lasting enjoyable experience. How to translate the functionality realization into a playful and intuitive solution is what I want to discuss with my design. It requires me, as a designer, to gain empathy with users and have a better understanding of their emotions.

            At current stage, I want to be a product designer with enthusiasm towards the thoughts and behavior of human beings, a project manager with ability of planning and vigorous execution, a design researcher with analysis capability to pinpoint the key issues of the design challenges.

            On the road of growth as a designer, the journey makes who I am. Bringing all keywords with me, entrepreneurship, culture awareness, design for human, the journey enables me to stay open, adaptive and empathetic as a person and a designer. Now, my master program is drawing to the end but the journey is not. I will keep challenging myself to step out of my comfort zone and my designs truly stem out of a place where it brings value to the world.

         <p>  
            After graduation, I expected to start job hunting in Europe and begin my design career as a product designer. In my first job, I will keep focusing on continuous learning and experience accumulation. In short term, I want to keep developing my skills in programming and prototyping which are essential abilities for an qualified designer. Besides, I will also develop my business sense and think about business value of design. As in the long term, my vision is to run my own start-up project and design my own products.
